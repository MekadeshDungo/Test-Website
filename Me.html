        <h4>LINGUISTICS</h4><br>
        <h5>Theories of Language Acquisition</h5>
          <p>1. Behaviorism: This theory, proposed by B.F. Skinner, suggests that language is learned through imitation, reinforcement, and conditioning. For example, a child might learn to say "thank you" after receiving positive reinforcement for using the phrase correctly.<br><br>
            2. Innateness: This theory, proposed by Noam Chomsky, argues that children are born with an innate ability to learn language. For example, a child might naturally understand grammatical rules without explicit instruction.<br><br>
            3. Cognitive Theory: This theory posits that language acquisition is a part of overall cognitive development. For example, as a child's cognitive abilities develop, so does their understanding and use of language.<br><br>
            4. Interactionalist Theory: These theories suggest that language acquisition is influenced by both environmental interaction and innate capabilities. For example, a child might learn language through interactions with their parents, as well as their own cognitive development.
            </p>
        <h5>Scope of Linguistics</h5><br>
        <p>1. Phonetics: The study of physical sounds in human speech. For example, the study of how the 'b' sound is produced.<br><br>
          2. Phonology: The study of how sounds function within a particular language. For example, the rules for combining sounds in English.<br><br>
          3. Morphology: The study of the internal structure of words. For example, understanding how adding 'un-' to 'happy' changes the meaning of the word.<br><br>
          4. Syntax: The study of how words combine to form sentences. For example, the rules for word order in a sentence.<br><br>
          5. Semantics: The study of meaning in language. For example, examining how the word 'love' can have different meanings in different contexts.<br><br>
          6. Pragmatics: The study of how context influences the interpretation of meaning. For example, understanding that the phrase "can you pass the salt?" is a request, not a question about ability.</p>
          <h5>Macro Linguistics</h5>
          <p>1. Sociolinguistics: The study of how language varies and changes in social groups. For
            example, studying how dialects vary between regions.<br><br>
            2. Psycholinguistics: The study of how language is processed in the brain. For example,
            studying how we understand ambiguous sentences.<br><br>
            3. Neurolinguistics: The study of how language is processed by the brain. For example, studying
            how damage to certain areas of the brain affects language ability.<br><br>
            4. Stylistics: The study of styles in languages. For example, analyzing the unique writing style of
            a particular author.<br><br>
            5. Discourse Analysis: The study of language in text and conversation. For example, analyzing a
            political speech to understand how language is used to persuade.<br><br>
            6. Computational Linguistics: The study of using computers to process human language. For
            example, developing algorithms for machine translation.<br><br>
            7. Cognitive Linguistics: The study of language as a part of our cognitive processes. For
            example, studying how our understanding of language influences our perception of the world.<br><br>
            8. Applied Linguistics: The application of linguistic theories, principles, and methods to solve
            real-world problems. For example, language teaching, translation, and language policy.</p>
            <H5>2 Types of Grammar</H5>
            <p>1. Descriptive Grammar: This refers to the structure of a language as it is actually used by
              speakers and writers. For example, using "ain't" in informal conversation.<br><br>
              2. Prescriptive Grammar: This refers to the explicit rules and structures of language as defined
              by grammar books and language usage guides. For example, the rule that a sentence should not
              end with a preposition.</p>
              <h5>SEMANTICS</h5>
              <p>● Semantics is the study of meaning that is used to understand human expression through
                language. It is also a branch of linguistics that is concerned with studying how meaning
                is constructed and communicated in written or spoken language.</p>
              <h5>CONNOTATION AND DENOTATION MEANING</h5>
                <p><b>DENOTATION</b> (Direct Expression)<br>
                  A word's denotative meaning is its main meaning, excluding any emotions or concepts that
                  individuals may associate with it. It is a phrase or expression’s clear and straightforward
                  meaning.<br>Example: "Home" (a place to stay, a house)</p>
                <p><b>CONNOTATION</b> (Indirect Expression)<br>It is an additional meaning to a word or term beyond its evident or simple meaning. Connotation
                  is the act of giving a word or expression a meaning other than its literal meaning.
                  Example: "Home" (a place of warmth, comfort, and affection) “Home is a person”</p>
                  <h5>WORD AND SENTENCES MEANING</h5>
                  <p><b>2 TYPES OF MEANING</b><br><br>
                  <b>CONCEPTUAL MEANING</b><br>
                  It is the simple, literal definition of the word from a dictionary, with no deeper meaning
                  conveyed or implication.<br>Example: “Sweet” (having the pleasant taste characteristic) “The honey tastes to sweet”
                <br><br><b>ASSOCIATIVE MEANING</b><br>An associative meaning has to do with the individual’s emotions/feelings or understanding of
                the word. It refers to the certain characteristics or traits that go beyond the literal meaning that
                people frequently associate with a word or phrase, whether that connection is accurate or not.
                Example: “Sweet” (kind and gentle towards other people) “My mother is so sweet when it comes
                to children”</p>
                <h5>SEMANTICS FEATURES</h5><p>Semantic Features are theoretical units of meaning-holding components which are used for
                  representing word meaning. It helps us finding the right noun in to the sentence and are
                  established by contrast and can be stated in terms of (+) or (-)</p>
                <table>
                  <thead><tr><th></th><th>Ball</th><th>Girl</th><th>Boy</th><th>Dog</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Human</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Female</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Male</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>+</td></tr>
                  </tbody>
                </table>
              <p>● Boy and girl is a semantic features of human.</p>
            
              <p><b>SEMANTICS ROLES</b><br>also known as thematic roles or theta roles. It is a role that the arguments (subject, object) play in
                a sentence.</p>
                <br><br>
              <p><b>Types of Semantics Roles</b><br><b>1. Agent</b> <center>- is the semantic role of a person or thing who is the doer of an event.</center><br>Example:<br>
                “Angela was bitten by the dog", Angela is the subject, dog is the agent.
                “Paul was chased by the flying cockroach”</p>
              <p><b>2. Goal</b><center>- is the entity from which the action of the verb originates. It is the place where
                something move something towards which an action is directed.</center><br>Example:<br>
                “He threw the book at me”, "threw" is the verb, “at me” is the direction.<br>
                “Paul swam to the left part of the pool.”</p>
              <p><b>3. Source</b><center>- The place of origin. Indicates the place or object where the movement expressed by the
                verb starts.</center><br>Example:<br>“Paul received the books from Jean”
                <br>“Jani picked up the pen from the box”</p>
              <p><b>4 . Theme</b><center>- The entity that is moved by the action or event denoted by the predicate.</center><br>Example:<br>
                “Mary kicked the ball”</p>
              <p><b>5. Beneficiary</b><center>- For “whose” benefit action was performed.</center><br>Example:<br>“Fiona bought a necklace for Clyde”<br>“I gave the bracelet to Airah for Darlyn”</p>
              <p><b>6. Location</b><center>- is a semantic role which identifies the location or spatial orientation of a state or action.
                A locative semantic role does not imply motion to, from, or across the location.</center><br>Example:<br>“The paper is in the bag”<br>“Zaira went to Canada last month”</p>
              <p><b>7. Time</b><center>- is the semantic role of the temporal placement of an event.</center>Example:<br>“The class will end at 1 pm.”<br>“Paul will have a date on Sunday”</p>
              <p><b>8. Manner</b><center>- is a semantic role that notes how the action, experience, or process of an event is
                carried out.</center><br>Example:<br>“Darlyn walked to school slowly”<br>“It rained heavily last night”</p>
              <p><b>9. Instrument</b><center>- The agent used to implement the event. It is the stimulus or immediate physical cause of
                an event.</center><br>Example:<br>“Paul was dragged by his horse for several meters” horse is the instrument.</p>
              <p><b>10. Experiencer</b><center>- The living entity that experiences the action or event.</center><br>Example:<br>“Aly felt cold.”<br>“Bea was scared”</p>
              <h5>LEXICAL RELATIONS</h5>
<p>It is the study of how lexicons are managed and how the lexical meanings of lexical items
interact with one another. It describes the relationships between the meanings of words. They are
one of the ways of understanding the meaning of words.<br>
<b>Types of Lexical Relations</b><br>
<b>1. Synonymy</b><br>
<center>- refers to a word with the same or that has a closely related meaning.</center><br>
Example:<br> • Pretty - Beautiful • Big - Large<br><br>
<b>2. Antonymy</b><br>
<center>- a pair of words with opposite meanings.</center><br>
Example:<br> • Poor - Rich • Big - Small<br><br>
<b>3. Hyponymy</b><br>
<center>- the lexical relation described in English by the phrase kind/type/sort of. It includes the
meaning of a more general word.</center><br>
Example:<br>
“Green, Blue, Red” is the hyponyms of ‘color’<br>
“1, 3, 5, 7, 9 11…” is the hyponyms of ‘odd number’<br><br>
<b>4. Prototypes</b><br>
<center>- A member or a set of members of a group that best represent the group as a whole.</center><br>
Example:<br> Chair is the prototype of ‘furniture’<br><br>
<b>5. Homophones</b><br>
<center>- words that sound the same but with different spelling and meaning.</center><br>
Example:<br> • know - no • ice - eyes • eight - ate<br><br>
<b>6. Homonyms</b><br>
<center>- words with same spelling and pronunciation but with different meanings</center><br>
Example:<br> • Right (correct) Right (direction) • Row (to paddle) Row (sets of people of things)<br><br>
<b>7. Polysemy</b><br>
<center>- several meanings of the word seem to be derived from one another.</center><br>
Example: “BAR”<br>
“We went to BAR last night”<br>
“ I have to study for the BAR”<br>
“I have a chocolate BAR </p>
<h5>PHRASAL / SENTENTIAL SEMANTICS</h5>
<p>• The meaning of syntactic units larger than words such as phrases and sentences.<br>
  • Verbs and a particle and/or a preposition co-occur forming a single semantic unit.<br><br>

  Example:<br><br>• “win over” to win • “act out” to perform</p>             
<p><b>COLLOCATION</b><br>Collocation is a word or phrase that is often used in another word or phrase, in a way that sounds
  correct to people who have spoken the language all their lives.
  Collocations are words that naturally go together.<br>
  Example:<br>
  Fast food (☑) Quick food (❎)<br>
  Super-fast train (☑) Quick train (❎)<br>
  Take a photo (☑) Make a photo (❎)</p>             
<h5>LANGUAGE, CULTURE, AND SOCIETY</h5>              
<p><b>ENGLISH</b><br><br>
  Six ways to pronounce /t/ in English: 
  [th] as in top <br> <br>
  [t] as in stop <br> <br>
  [t] as in pot <br> <br>
  [r] as in little <br> <br>
  [?] as in kitten <br> <br>
  [ ] as in hunter</p>   
<h5>PRONUNCIATION</h5><br>
<p>● It is about the formation of words sounds. It refers to the manner we make speech sounds.<br>
  ● We use stress, syllables, intonation and rhythm in order to change the sound of word.</p>
<h5>ARTICULATION</h5><br>
<p>● It refers to speaking in a clear and understandable way, precisely and not slurring or
  mumbling.<br>
  ● It is the clarity in which the sounds are made regardless of wether they are pronounced
  correctly.</p>
  <h5>ENGLISH ALPHABET</h5><br>
  <p>● 26 letters<br>
    ● 5 vowels<br>
    ● 21consonants</p>
<P><b>VOWELS</b><br>● A E I O U Sometimes y<br><br>PLACE OF ARTICULATION<br><br>● is where the consonants are produced<br><br>MANNER OF ARTICULATION<br><br>● how the consonants are produced.</P>
 <p><b>SYMBOLS</b><br>I<br><br>ɪ<br><br>e<br><br>Ɛ<br><br>æ</p>
<br><b>IPA (INTERNATIONAL PHONETIC ALPHABET NAMES)</b>
<p> I - high front unrounded vowel<br><br>ɪ - high front lax unrounded vowel<br><br>e - mid-front unrounded vowel<br><br>Ɛ - mid-front lax unrounded vowel<br><br>æ - low front unrounded vowel</p>
<p><b>TRADITIONAL NAME</b><br><br>
  I - the long e sound<br><br>
  ɪ - the short i sound<br><br>
  e - the long a sound<br><br>
  Ɛ - the short e sound<br><br>
  æ - the short a sound</p>
<h5>DIPHTHONGS</h5>
<p>● It is a single syllable that is combine with two vowels where a sound is formed.<br>
  ● There are eight diphthongs commonly used in English: /eɪ/, /aɪ/, /əʊ/, /aʊ/, /ɔɪ/,
  /ɪə/, /eə/, and /ʊə/<br>
  ❖ /aɪ/ Creates a speech sound similar to “eye” and usually includes the letters /i/,
  /igh/, and /y. Examples: my, cry, light, like<br>
  ❖ /əʊ/ Creates a speech sound similar to “boat” and usually includes the letters /ow/,
  /oa/ and /o/.Examples: tow, loan,though<br>
  ❖ /eɪ/ Creates a speech sound similar to “great” and usually includes the letters /ey/,
  /ay/, /ai/ and /a/. Examples: steak, pain, weight<br>
  ❖ /aʊ/ Creates a speech sound similar to “ow!” and usually includes the letters /ou/
  and /ow/. Examples: town, found, cow<br>
  ❖ /ɪə/ Creates a speech sound similar to “ear” and usually includes the letters /ee/,
  /ie/ and /ea/. Examples: leer, tear, pier<br>
  ❖ /eə/ Creates a speech sound similar to “air” and usually includes the letters /ai/,
  /a/, and /ea/. Examples: lair, bear<br>
  ❖ /ɔɪ/ Creates a speech sound similar to “boy” and usually includes the letters /oy/
  and /oi/. Examples: oil, coy, roil<br>
  ❖ /ʊə/ Creates a speech sound similar to “sure” and usually includes the letters /oo/,
  /ou/, /u/, and /ue/. Examples: cure, cur</p>
  <br><b>FRONT VOWELS</b>
<p>● are produced by the placement of the tongue tip in various positions from the upperincisors (the front cutting teeth) to the lower ones.<br>● The front vowels in American English are /i/, /ɪ/, /e/, /ɛ/, and /æ/, and are made with the<br>front of the tongue arched.</p>
<br><b>BACK VOWELS</b><br><br><p>● The back vowels or the four vowels sound are [u], [U], [o], [c] are made with the
  back of the tongue raise going from high to low.</p><br>
  <P>• /u/ - LONG SOUND<br><br>• /ʊ/ - SHORT SOUND<br><br>• /o/ - LONG SOUND<br><br>• /ɔ/ - SHORT SOUND</P>
<P><b>MID VOWELS</b><br><br>
  ❖ is a sound of a vowel produced when a vowel is positioned in the middle of a
  three-letter word or CVC words.<br><br>
  ❖ Middle vowel sound can be a short vowel sound such as a, e, i, o, u, or a long
  vowel sound such as ai, ee, igh, etc..<br><br>
  ❖ An upside down 'e' /ə/ is called a schwa.<br><br>
  ❖ close mid central unrounded vowel [ɘ̞] or [ɜ̝] (most written ⟨ə⟩).<br><br>
  ❖ an upside down 'v' . [ᴧ] is called a wedge.</P>
  <h5>CONSONANTS: PLACE AND MANNER OF ARTICULATION</h5>
  <p><b>PLACE OF ARTICULATION</b><br><br>
    ● The place of articulation refers to where the articulators (tongue, teeth, lips, or
    glottis) make contact in the vocal tract to create consonant sounds<br>
    ❖ Bilabial (from bi ‘two ’ + labial ‘lips ’) - The primary constriction is at the lips
    (/p,b,m,w/).<br>
    ❖ Labiodental (from labio ‘lip ’ + dental ‘teeth’) - The primary constriction is
    between the lower lip and the upper teeth (/f,v/)<br>
    ❖ Interdental (from inter ‘between ’ + dental ‘teeth’) - The primary constriction is
    between the tongue and the upper teeth (/θ,ð/).<br>
    ❖ Alveolar (from alveolar ridge) - The primary constriction is between the tongueand the alveolar ridge (/t,d,s,z,n,l/).<br>❖ Palatal (from palate) - The primary constricton is between the tongue and thepalate (/š,ž,č,ǰ,r,y/)<br>❖ Velar (from velum) - The primary constriction is between the tongue and thevelum (/k,g,ŋ/).<br>❖ Glottal (from glottis, which refers to the space between the vocal cords) - Theprimary constriction is at the glottis (/h/).</p>
    <p><b>MANNER OF ARTICULATION</b><br><br>● The manner of articulation is the configuration and interaction of the articulators(speech organs such as the tongue, lips, and palate) when making a speech sound,one parameter of manner is stricture</p>
<P><b>CONSONANTS: VOICED AND VOICELESS CONSONANTS</b><br><br>
  ● These are the voiced consonants: B, D, G, J, L, M, N, Ng, R, Sz, Th (as in the word
  "then"), V, W, Y, and Z.<br>
  ● These are the voiceless consonants: Ch, F, K, P, S, Sh, T, and Th (as in "thing").</P>
<P><b>SUPRASEGMENTALS</b><br><br>
  ● Phenomena beyond the sound segment<br>
  ● Prosodic properties that form part of the makeup of sounds no matter what their<br>
  place or manner of articulation is.</P>
<p><b>PITCH</b><br><br>
  ● Pertains to the high and low of sounds. How high or low the sound produces
  depends on the vocal folds, specifically the rate at which they vibrate,
  Independent from other features.<br>
  ● If the vocal folds vibrates faster, then it will produce a higher pitch.<br>
  ● It has 3 levels of sound which is the LOW, NORMAL, AND HIGH.</p>
